    <h1>
    Basic HTML Animals
    </h1>
        
    This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.
        
    <h2>
    The Llama
    </h2>
        
    Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
        
    <h2>
    The Anaconda
    </h2>
        
    The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
